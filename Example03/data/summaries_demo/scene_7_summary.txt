The AI technology being described involves a system that can understand language and answer questions, with the ability to access multimodal data such as images. There are three main components: infinite context windows, agents, and text-to-code. Infinite context windows allow for step-by-step planning by feeding information back into the system, while agents are used to act on input and respond accordingly. The third component is text-to-code, which involves a computer writing a program based on user input.

The development of AI technology has three main goals: infinite context windows, agents, and text-to-code. Infinite context windows aim to increase intelligence by planning steps in a system. Agents are being used more frequently but often lack clear objectives, with companies wanting to control their interactions. Text-to-code is intended to automate tasks, such as identifying and ranking experts in specific fields.

The three main competitors (Facebook, Google, Microsoft) are vying for the best reasoning capabilities, predictive analytics, image classifier, and multimodal technology. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) refers to a computer system that can generate its own objective functions and goals, but it is still not clear when this will occur. The San Francisco School of AI researchers estimate that AGI may emerge within 2-3 years from now, but this is likely not the case.

The development of AGI requires significant advancements in AI technology, which are being pursued by the three main competitors and their respective research teams.
