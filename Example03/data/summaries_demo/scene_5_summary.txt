Here is a concise summary of the text in five sentences:

The author believes that in one year, programmers will replace most human programmers and by two years, graduate-level mathematicians will be developed at the top of their fields. The development of advanced mathematical capabilities is attributed to the use of algorithms that mimic word prediction and proof formats used in programming. In three to five years, computers may develop general intelligence, also known as superintelligence or artificial superintelligence. As a result, humans would need to re-architect problems and create new systems, including agents that can learn from data without human input. The author suggests that automation will not eliminate jobs, but rather make them more productive for those who are working hard in the next 30-40 years.
